# Java Battleship Game

## Overview

This repository contains a Java implementation of the classic game "Battleship". Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

## Features

- **Two-Player Gameplay:** The game is designed for two players, each taking turns to make their move.
- **Ship Placement:** At the beginning of the game, players place their fleet of ships on the grid.
- **Hit or Miss Feedback:** The game provides immediate feedback when a ship is hit, missed, or sunk.

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game:** Run the Java program to start the game. Each player is prompted to place their fleet on their respective grid.
2. **Playing Turns:** Players take turns guessing the coordinates on the opponent's grid where they believe the opponent's ships are located.
3. **Hit, Miss, and Sunk:** The game reports whether the attack was a hit, a miss, or if it resulted in sinking one of the ships.
4. **Game End:** The game ends when one player successfully sinks all ships of the opponent. A congratulatory message is displayed announcing the winner.
